# Future of Pipelines

1. Model Experiment Tracking
    - Weights and biases
    - Sacred
2. Model Release Management / Model Versioning
    - Input data change -> minor version change
    - Hyperparameters change -> major version change
    - Model architecture change -> new pipeline
3. Data Versioning
4. Data Privacy
    - Federated Learning
    - Encrypted Learning
    - Differential Privacy
5. Data Streams (instead of Data Batches)
6. Carbon Emissions
7. Other Problems: Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning
8. Testing Capabilities: Unit Test, End-to-End Test, Test(inference time, memory consumption, battery consumption on mobile devices, model size vs accuracy)
