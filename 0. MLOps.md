# MLOps: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) & Continuous Testing (CT)

Motivation: Build a ML model that continuously operate in production

## DevOps vs MLOps

MLOps: Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) & Continuous Testing (CT)

## Levels of MLOps
1. Level 0: Manual Process (no change in model)
    - Manual, script-driven, and interactive process: Every step is manual (data analysis, data preparation, model training, etc). The experimental code is written and interactively executed in notebooks.
    - Common in many businesses that are beginning to apply ML to their use cases
    - Downsides:
        - Disconnection between ML and operations: Separates data scientists who create the model and engineers who serve the model as a prediction service
        - Infrequent release iterations: The process assumes that your data science team manages a few models that don't change frequently (either changing model implementation or retraining the model with new data). A new model version is deployed only a couple of times per year.
        - Lack of active performance monitoring: The process doesn't track or log the model predictions and actions, which are required in order to detect model performance degradation and other model behavioral drifts.
        - The models fail to adapt to changes in the dynamics of the environment, or changes in the data that describes the environment

3. Level 1: ML pipeline automation (suitable for new model based on new data)

5. Level 2: CI/CD pipeline automation (suitable for new model based on new architecture)
