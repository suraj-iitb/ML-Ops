# TensorFlow Extended (TFX)
It provides components of the ML pipelines

1. Data Ingestion: Examplegen
2. Data Validation: ExampleValidator, StatisticsGen, SchemaGen (tensorflow-data-validation)
3. Data Preprocessing: Transform (tensorflow-transform)
4. Model Training: Trainer, Tuner
5. Model Analysis: Evaluator, ResolverNode, Pusher (tensorflow-model-analysis)
6. Model Deployment: ModelServer (tensorflow-model-server)
 

**Note**: TFX components internally uses Apache Beam (for distributed processing)

## Overview of Components
1. Three parts of the components
    - Driver: Reads input metadata from the metadata store
    - Executor: Processes the loaded data
    - Publisher: Writes output metadata into the metadata store
2. Artifacts: Inputs/Outputs to the components. Eg: Raw input data, preprocessed data, trained model, etc. 
    - Each artifact has associated metadata (artifact type, artifact properties) stored in the MetaDataStore
