# TensorFlow Extended (TFX)
It provides components of the ML pipelines

1. Data Ingestion: Examplegen
2. Data Validation: ExampleValidator, StatisticsGen, SchemaGen (tensorflow-data-validation)
3. Data Preprocessing: Transform (tensorflow-transform)
4. Model Training: Trainer, Tuner
5. Model Analysis: Evaluator, ResolverNode, Pusher (tensorflow-model-analysis)
6. Model Deployment: ModelServer (tensorflow-model-server)
 

**Note**: TFX components internally uses Apache Beam (for distributed processing)

## Overview of Components
1. Three parts of the components
    - Driver: Reads input metadata from the metadata store
    - Executor: Processes the loaded data
    - Publisher: Writes output metadata into the metadata store
2. Artifacts: Inputs/Outputs to the components. Eg: Raw input data, preprocessed data, trained model, etc.
3. ML MetaData (MLMD): Each artifact has associated metadata (artifact type, artifact properties) stored in the metadata store
    - Info is centrally stored
    - Three types of database backend support: In-memory DB (via SQLite), SQLite, MySQL

## Interactive Pipelines
1. Makes debugging easier since it runs in Jupyter Notebook (Orchestreted by User)
2. Once we are sure our pipeline is working fine, we can convert it into Production Pipeline (Orchestreted by Apache Airflow)

## Other Alternatives of TFX
1. Metaflow (Netflix)
2. Luigi (Spotify)
3. AeroSolve (AirBnb)
4. Stripe (Railyard)
5. Michelangelo (Uber)
