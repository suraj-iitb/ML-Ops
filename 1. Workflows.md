# Machine Learning Workflows/Pipelines
There are 2 types of ML workflows
- Manual
- Automated: more dev time for new models, simpler & less error-prone update process for existing models, less time for reproducibility of existing models, standardization

## Why Automated ML Workflows?
1. Ability to focus on new models, not maintaining existing models
    - Maintaining existing models means running pre-processing scripts, deployment scripts, tuning of models etc
    - Job satisfaction since they will work work on new models
2. Prevention of bugs
    - Model is tied to pre-processing steps (New model for new pre-processing steps): In manual workflow, if we change pre-processing steps after the model was trained without retraining the model, then there is mismatch in pre-processing steps during training and inference time. Model won't complain about it but it is incorrect/buggy. 
    - Model is tied to versioned data (New model for new data)
3. Useful paper trail
    - Experiment tracking: records hyperparameters, dataset, metrics
    - Model release management: which model was selected and deployed
    - Assist if questions are asked around Data protection Laws (Eg: Europe has General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))
4. Standardization
    - Easy onboarding/transfer   
    
## When to use Automated ML Workflows?
1. When model has user-base: continuous update of the model is necessary
2. Large projects
